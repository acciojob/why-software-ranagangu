  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I am passionate about solving problems through technology. 
    I enjoy the process of building applications that can make peopleâ€™s lives easier, more productive, and more connected. 
    Programming allows me to be creative and logical at the same time, and I find great satisfaction in seeing my code come to life.
    Moreover, the tech industry offers endless opportunities for learning and growth, which motivates me to continuously improve my skills 
    and contribute to meaningful projects.
